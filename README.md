# RFID-Aliexpress-Reader

A small fix for aliexpress Reader that some of them does not output on notepad the whole decimal and added a converter that automaticly converts from decimal to HEXDecimal in order to clone for proxmark and saves automaticly to a output.txt file


If you Get 8 HEX DIGITS, JUST ADD 00 FIRST 2 HEX DIGITS in order to get the whole 10 HEX DIGITS
